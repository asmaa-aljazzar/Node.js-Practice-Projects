# Node.js Practice Projects

> *A structured collection of Node.js practice projects organized by topic and difficulty. Each concept—such as file system, events, and HTTP—is explored through easy, medium, and hard exercises to strengthen backend fundamentals through progressive challenges.*

This repository is a collection of Node.js practice exercises, organized by **topic** and **difficulty level**. Each topic explores a core Node.js concept, with three progressively challenging projects: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

-   `read-and-write` – File system operations using the `fs` module.
-   `events` – Custom `EventEmitter` and asynchronous event handling.
-   `http-server` – Basic server creation and request handling.
-   `path` – Working with directory and file paths.
-   `streams` – Reading and writing data streams.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### The repository follows a consistent pattern:

nodejs-practice/
├── read-and-write/
│ ├── easy/
│ ├── medium/
│ └── hard/
├── events/
│ ├── easy/
│ ├── medium/
│ └── hard/
├── http-server/
│ ├── easy/
│ ├── medium/
│ └── hard/
└── ...other topics/
### Folder Description

-   **Topic folder** (e.g., `read-and-write`): Contains all exercises for a main Node.js concept.
-   **Difficulty folders**: Projects of increasing complexity:
    -   `easy/` – Basic usage and syntax.
    -   `medium/` – Practical examples using multiple modules or logic.
    -   `hard/` – Mini-projects combining topics or simulating real scenarios.

Each difficulty folder typically contains an `index.js` main script, optional support files (modules, logs, or JSON data), and an optional `README.md` with specific notes or instructions.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1.  Navigate to any project directory:
    ```bash
    cd read-and-write/easy
    ```
2.  Run the Node.js script:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to build a solid foundational understanding of Node.js by applying each concept in practical, incremental steps. This format encourages mastery through repetition and gradual complexity—ideal for self-learning, practice, and technical interview preparation.
